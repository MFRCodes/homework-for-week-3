    <h2>About Mariah Carey</h2>

    <p>Mariah Carey is the member of the vocal trinity who is known for her vocal gymnastics. Her range and ability to seemlessly sing in and switch through different registers is incomparable. She's especially known for belting whistle notes which is difficult to do even for seasoned vocalists. I'll go as far as to say that within the vocal trinity, Mariah Carey's albums are my favorite music catalog. I especially love her live performances. Her MTV Unplugged concert is a must to listen to! I wish I could have been a member of that audience. Hearing the way her audience engages with her during said concert is testament to her talent. </p>



    <h2>Favorite Mariah Carey Album</h2>
    <p>Her 1995 album "Daydream"</p>
