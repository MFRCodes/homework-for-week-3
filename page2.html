    <h2>About Celine Dion</h2>

    <p>Celine Dion has always held a special place in my heart because of the cultural impact she's had and continues to have on Caribbean culture. She is especialy adored in Haitian and Jamaican households as her songs are often must haves on wedding playlists. People around the world know Celine for her bold note choices and impressive breath control. I vividly remember runnning out of breath as a kid whenever I would try to sing her songs. What sets Celine apart from the others in the vocal trinity is that her music is not only catered to the Anglophone world. Her french songs and albums took the Francophone world by storm and they are some of my favorite music from her. These days, whenever music lovers listen to albums, they often rate albums based on whether or not the album has any songs that can be skipped. One of my favorite things about Celine's albums is that none of her albums in my opinion have any skips. Oh, and her French albums, are a must to listen to. </p>
